# Movie-recommender-system


## Description
This is to build a hybrid movie recommendation system, which has combined the contents from movies' description and reviews. TF-IDF is used for data transformations and LDA is implmented to extract latent topic from reviews. The cosine similarity and Jensenâ€“Shannon distance are used to calculate the similarity of the documents.
