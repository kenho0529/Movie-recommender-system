# Movie-recommender-system


## Description
This is to build a hybrid movie recommendation system, which has combined the contents from movies' description and reviews. TF-IDF is used for data transformations and LDA is implmented to extract latent topic from reviews. The cosine similarity and Jensenâ€“Shannon distance are used to calculate the similarity of the documents.

## Data
I have used the data of rotton tomatoes from Kaggle.  
Original Data:  
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset)

The reviews and movie database are preprossed. The reviews DB is tokenized and lemmatized. Since it takes extremely long for lemmatization, the process is done before. A lemmatized database can be found below.

## How to run
1. Download the whole file and unzipped the data in data file.
2. Run cosine_matrix.py to get the cosine similarity matrix for saving time.
3. Run movie_rs.py.

## Web App Version
The recommendation system is deployed on a simple Flask web app.  
Run route.py and get the local url, which is in a format of http://127.0.0.1:5000/.  

The poster is from themoviedb API and IMDb movie ID is obtained from IMDB library.
